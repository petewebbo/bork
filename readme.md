# BORK

A very incomplete tui drum machine.

## Build and run

Requires CMake, a C/C++20 toolchain, Git and internet access on the first build.
CMake fetches PortAudio 19.7.0, fmt and AudioFile. On Linux, install the development
packages for your native PortAudio backend (for example `libasound2-dev` for ALSA).
macOS uses CoreAudio; no JACK server or JACK development package is required.

```sh
./build.sh
./.build/bork
ctest --test-dir .build --output-on-failure
```

The audio engine opens PortAudio's default output device at its default sample
rate, using stereo when available (mono otherwise). It does not open an input
stream. The mono sequencer mix is sent to every output channel. Press Enter to
stop and close the stream.

The three sample paths in `src/main.cpp` are still the original absolute paths;
change them to point to your files. Samples are not resampled, so use samples
matching the output sample rate. The TUI experiments remain separate and unchanged.

`inc/ezpz_portaudio.hpp` replaces the JACK wrapper and retains the virtual
`process` interface with non-interleaved float buffers. Derived classes must stop
the stream before destroying state used by the callback. Variable callback sizes
are processed in bounded chunks, without allocating in the audio callback.

The wrapper test stubs PortAudio's device API, so it can test lifecycle, callback
buffers and error handling without opening an audio device. Live playback must
be checked separately.
